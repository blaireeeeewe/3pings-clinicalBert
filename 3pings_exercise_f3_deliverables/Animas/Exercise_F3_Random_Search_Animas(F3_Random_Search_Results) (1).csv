,Best F1 Score,0.8630,0.8200,Random Search uses automated optimization,,,,,,,
,Total Time (seconds),31228.8,5400.0,Time for 6 automated trials,,,,,,,
,Efficiency (F1/Time),0.000028,0.000152,Higher is better,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
,Analysis Notes:,,,,,,,,,,
,1. Random Search uses automated hyperparameter optimization,,,,,,,,,,
,2. Exercise F2 used manual hyperparameter tuning,,,,,,,,,,
,3. Random Search can explore continuous hyperparameter ranges,,,,,,,,,,
,4. Efficiency = Best F1 Score / Total Time,,,,,,,,,,
