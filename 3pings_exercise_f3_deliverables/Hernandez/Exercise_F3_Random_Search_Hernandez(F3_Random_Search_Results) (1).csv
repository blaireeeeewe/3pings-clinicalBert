Metric,Random Search (Automated),Exercise F2 (Manual),Notes,,,,,,,,
Best F1 Score,0.8733,0.8200,Random Search uses automated optimization,,,,,,,,
Total Time (seconds),21645.0,5400.0,Time for 6 automated trials,,,,,,,,
Efficiency (F1/Time),0.000040,0.000152,Higher is better,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,
Analysis Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Random Search uses automated hyperparameter optimization,,,,,,,,,,,
2. Exercise F2 used manual hyperparameter tuning,,,,,,,,,,,
3. Random Search can explore continuous hyperparameter ranges,,,,,,,,,,,
4. Efficiency = Best F1 Score / Total Time,,,,,,,,,,,
